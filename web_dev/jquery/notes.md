# How to Learn JQuery

1. How does the language encapsulate data?
2. When the language executes code
3. Where do the curly brackets and semi-colons go?

## Questions
1. How do you use jquery?
2. how do you require jquery?
3. how is it executed?
4. What is it used for?
5. How is it related to javascript?
6. Cheat sheets???
7. What are some examples/demonstrations of jquery
8. how do i install jquery? and use it?

## Strategies
I found some jquery youtube videos which were pretty helpful to see it in action. Cheat Sheets are pretty useful as some lead to even the relevant documentation. Some challenges I came across was my unfamiliarity with javascript and css. I realize, using the JQUERY library is only as useful insofar as I'm comfortable utilizing javascript and css commands. Otherwise, I kept looking up the documentation for all three rather than focusing on the benefits of jquery. 

I also struggled on this challenge feeling lost and aimless. Almost like Meno's paradox... not knowing to start because I know not what I seek.
