1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Whereas some operating systems were created from the philosophy of protecting or shielding the user from harming the computer or ways to harm themselves becuase of their computer illiteracy, Linux was designed from a counter-philosophy assuming a computer literature user that should be given full access to communicate with that computer.

In short, it assumes that the user knows what they are doing and does not assume that the user is illterate or unaware.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS mimics an actual computer but its environment can be digitally set up. Without the physical components, it can mimic and run like an actual computer in any part of the world operating on any operating system. The advantage of this is that if you botch it, you can destroy it and start a new one relatively easily. Also, it's cheaper to mimic a computer than buy several different kinds of real computers.


3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Its a baseline security model. Operating as the root user is like going "dictator mode" on your machine. Without any restrictions, its much easier to wipe your whole system or make an error you did not mean to, whereas operating as a user, you could add such gaurdrails. Like the beloved Ben Parker once said, "With great power comes great responsibility".
