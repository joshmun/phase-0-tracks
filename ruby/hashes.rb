#Pseudocode
#The program will ask the user these questions:
#client name
#age
# => convert to integoer
#number of children
# => convert to integoer
#decor theme
#Do you live on the west coast?
#Do you live on the east coast?
#print the results and store in a hash
#ask the user if all the information is correct
#if not, provide same questions but as updating previous hash
# => no loop, but utilize new gets.chomp to update symbols
#if so, then skip by stating 'none'
#print the results and exit
