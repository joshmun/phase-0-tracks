# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system of managing revision control, most commonly utilized by Git and hosted on GitHub. Version control is useful for cross-collaboration and protecting the code. Version control allows multiple users to access the same code, simultaneously develop on that code, and track the revisions each user contributes. If an error occurs, version control allows the project to be rolled back to any previous version in its history. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is another version or copy of the original source code. We use them so that we can focus on developing on a new feature that is separate from the source code, thus protecting the source code from feature development changes. Utilizing multiple branches is always useful when attempting to simulatenously develop across multiple users.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message succinctly describes the changes to the code, and begins with action verbs in the imperative mode such as "Fix, Add, Change".

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches have changes that disagree or contain conflicting information such that they cannot be combined. Specifically, merge conflicts occur when one of the merging branches have commits that do not exist in the other branch.
